# GNG is Not Gradle

I worked on a lot of gradle-based projects with different gradle versions. A global installed
gradle distribution  not only make no sense to me but also sometimes confuses me which gradle version I ran from command
line. Keep typing `./gradlew` is cumbersome. Even worse when you have to type `../gradlew`, or `../../gradlew`.

GNG is a script that automatically search your `gradlew` when you are inside your Gradle project and execute it. 
It also provides a bootstrap function installing any Gradle wrapper version you prefer If you are creating a new Gradle project.

This is originally inspired by [gdub](https://www.gdub.rocks/) and [gradlew-bootstrap](https://github.com/viphe/gradlew-bootstrap). 
I shamelessly steal some code from them.

# How GNG installs your Gradle Wrapper?

Internally, it uses an embedded Gradle Wrapper with version 1.0 distribution. The reason use `1.0` is the small distribution package size.
You can trust the embedded gradle-wrapper.jar. It is verified by [Gradle Wrapper Validation](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gradle-wrapper-validation).

#Usage

If you don't have any Gradle distribution, please don't worry. just type `gng --bootstrap`. It will create a Gradle wrapper in your current
working directory. By default, `gng` installs Gradle wrapper with version `4.8.1`. Or you can use `gng --bootstrap [version]` to install 
whatever Gradle version you like.

In existing Gradle project, instead of typing `./gradlew`, just type `gng`, then your life will be easier.

# Installation

## Homebrew

```bash
brew install gng
```

>
>To install homebrew, visit [Homebrew Offical Site](https://brew.sh/), or excute 
>```bash
>/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
>```
>
## Installing from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dantesun/gng.git
cd gng
sudo ./install
```

## Aliasing the `gradle` command
To avoid using any system wide Gradle distribution add a `gradle` alias to `gw` to your shell's configuration file.

Example *bash*:

```bash
echo "alias gradle=gng" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export PATH=/usr/local/bin:${PATH}" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
